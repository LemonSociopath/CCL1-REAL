## ‚úçÔ∏è **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **Plans vs Reality:** I managed to complete basically everything I wanted out of my game.
- **Core Mechanics:** I was able to implement far more thanexpected, both in terms of status effects during battle and adding dialogue after certain accomplishamnts from the player.

### Challenges:
- **Pressure:** Both too much and not enough pressure. First week I was able to motivate myself to work nonstop, only to burn out in the second and spend 12+ hours sleeping most days since my mind couldn't handle it. Only on the final 48 hours I felt the dealine was harsh enough again that I managed to force myself out of bed.
- **Visual Fixes:** I had some issue with placement of elemens in the battle system, which I expected to be easy so I got more annoyed by it than I should have.
- **This Submission:** I really do unrestand my code and my game, I''ve made changes on so many occasions, but I cannot for the life of me talk about it or explain it. I don't have the professional vocabulary required, I just understand it in a way of "touch hot stove- it hurts - itll hurt more or less depending on the power of the stove", rather than "I know why my skin feels pain and how does it happen that the stove can change its temperature with a click".

### Lessons Learned:
- **When under pressure, don't stand out:** Don't try to stand out because I suffered and couldn't ask peers for help since they had a completely different code.
- **Give yourself rewards:** Celebrating small accomplishments could have helped my mental state.
- **Give your game to the most annoying friend:** Easiest way to find bugs.
