## ‚úçÔ∏è **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **Plans vs Reality:** I managed to complete basically everything I wanted out of my game.
- **Core Mechanics:** I was able to implement far more thanexpected, both in terms of status effects during battle and adding dialogue after certain accomplishamnts from the player.

### Challenges:
- **Pressure:** Both too much and not enough pressure. First week I was able to motivate myself to work nonstop, only to burn out in the second and spend 12+ hours sleeping most days since my mind couldn't handle it. Only on the final 48 hours I felt the dealine was harsh enough again that I managed to force myself out of bed.
- **Visual Fixes:** I had some issue with placement of elemens in the battle system, which I expected to be easy so I got more annoyed by it than I should have.

### Lessons Learned:
- **When under pressure, don't stand out:** Don't try to stand out because I suffered and couldn't ask peers for help since they had a completely different code.
- **Keep it Simple:** Focusing on one unique mechanic instead of multiple features made the game more polished.
