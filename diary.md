Today I managed to set up my game canvas, upload substitute images for characters and maps, create first game object(npcs, player character) and the collision detection on walls.

### 15/01/25
Today I first implemented smooth grid movement, camera movement, set behaviour loops and some blueprints for dialogue.

### 16/01/25
Today I applied collision detecion on my npcs, worked on first PROPER sprite sheet for my player character and art for map. Sprite sheet animations to work in game. Text slowly revealing effect.

### 17/01/25 -20/01/25
I was beginning to feel exhausted so I did not write daily entrees and it was a blur so I'm adding this all together.
I was working on implementing the turn based battle system with a tutorial, which took two days. Then at night of 19th and on 20th I was correcting and debugging it to suit my needs, as the tutorial was suited for a bit different battle system. I set up the exp system to only give exp once from each enemy, to later use the total sum as the 'end game' requirement.

### 21/01/2025
Mental exhaustion, I slept for 15 hours. Ended up working on dialogue on my phone. Changed some simple visual aspects of the UI.

### 22/01/2025
Forced to lock in. Today I worked on all the art for npc's, set up beginning cutscene, finished the spritesheet for protagonist to be polished and not 'hovering'. Battle system apparently still needed some fixing, I also gave each npc bigger variety of actions during it, so that depending on their personality some are more offensive, some fully defensive etc. Got rid of exp bar that I implimented while doing the tutorial, as it was quite useless for my game, kept the exp system.

Writitng this the final day of the CCL, as I worked the entire night, rather than during the day. Created end screen art, added the 'host' npc and their dialogue. Set up a 'flag' so that the dialogue changes for the host after the exp goal has been met. Created host's sprites, as they only were using substitutes.  Added music and custom font. Added delta time, though I didn't find it very necessary. Finished adding everything exactly 8:49am.

The game already had a beginning, but I wanted to add a proper starting page so I did.
